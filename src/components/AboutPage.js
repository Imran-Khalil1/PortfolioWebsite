            I'm Imran Khalil. I am a <span>Software Developer</span>. I have
            done my Bachelors Degree in Software Engineering from{" "}
            <span>Bahria University</span>, Islamabad.

            I specialize in efficient <span>React</span> apps using
            <span> Material UI</span> & <span>Bootstrap</span> that just work across all
            platforms and browsers. I care deeply about building interfaces that
            are usable and pleasant for the most number of people possible.

            Right now, Iâ€™m excited about improving skills on writing good
